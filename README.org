#+TITLE: Benchmarks using in CoDBM papers(s)

Benchmarks used in Compact Difference Bound Matrices (APLAS 17) and
Incrementally Closing Octagons (FMSD)

Can be used with the APLAS17 implementation
(github.com/aziem/apron-aplas) and the subsequently improved version
(github.com/aziem/apron-kent)

Each folder contains a runeva.sh script which executes frama-c on the
benchmark. The script uses multitime
(http://tratt.net/laurie/src/multitime/) and requires frama-c to be
installed with the binary available from $PATH. (We usually install
frama-c via opam).
